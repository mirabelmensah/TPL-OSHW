# Custom Cryogenic Feedthrough

This repository contains the open-source PCB designs for a custom cryogenic feedthrough system developed for the CS204-DMX-20 cryostat.
The hardware is intended for researchers working with photonic devices at cryogenic temperatures, providing a compact, reliable interface between room-temperature electronics and the cryostat interior.
